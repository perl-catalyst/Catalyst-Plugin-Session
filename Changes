Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Session

0.07
        - Make build tool complain loudly on incompatible versions of state
          plugins.

0.06
        - Change State plugin API to be pull oriented
        - Lazify more correctly (mostly performance improvements)
        - Don't try to compute digest of hash when there is no hash

0.05     
        - Un-workaround the Cache::FastMmap (actually Storable) limitation -
          it's not C::P::Session's business.
        - add $c->session_expires
        - refactor guts
        - improve semantics of session deletion (now deletes flash data too)
        - improve lazy-load-ness of session data in the light of expiration

        - Work around a limitation in Cache::FastMmap - must store only
          references, while expiration was an NV.

0.03    2005-12-26 10:22:00
        - Lazify loading of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions
        - support for $c->flash a la Ruby on Rails
        - Fixed bug in sessionid algorithm detection.
        - Separate __expires from the session data - we write it every time
        - Lazify saving of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions
